Credit card,"Reference # XXXX Dear Chase Card Services, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep frustration and dissatisfaction with the challenges I have encountered while attempting to open business credit cards with Chase. As a longstanding customer, I have recently experienced a series of perplexing and time-consuming issues that have significantly impacted my confidence in the application process. 

In early XXXX, I applied for the Chase Ink Business card, and to my relief, the application was swiftly approved. However, my satisfaction was short-lived when I faced difficulties creating an online account for the card. Upon contacting Chase, I was directed to the fraud department, where I was asked a question about a loan from decades ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't recall the answer, leading to a requirement to visit a Chase branch to verify my identity and confirm that I was indeed the applicant and not a victim of identity theft. Although the in-person visit resolved the issue, the inconvenience and uncertainty surrounding this process were disheartening. 

Fast forward to early XXXX, when I applied for another Chase Ink Business card under a different business entity ( the first being a sole proprietorship and the second with a valid business EIN ). Despite having recently and physically verified my identity at a Chase branch with XXXX forms of identification for a similar application just XXXX months prior, I am once again being asked to submit additional documents to verify my identity. This repeated demand for verification is perplexing and frustrating, given that I am not a victim of identity theft, have never been one, and have never placed a credit freeze on my account. My loyalty to Chase over the years adds to my confusion as to why my business applications consistently undergo a secondary verification process, citing reasons such as "" Name verification - name provided is unable to be verified. '' I am reaching out to seek resolution and clarity on this matter. I am requesting a thorough review of my account and the application process to identify the root cause of these persistent issues. It is crucial to understand why my applications are subject to additional scrutiny, especially when others do not face such hurdles.

I value my relationship with Chase and believe in the importance of security measures. However, the repeated and seemingly unnecessary verification process is eroding the trust I have placed in the bank 's systems. I trust that you will investigate this matter promptly and provide a resolution that ensures a smoother and more efficient experience for loyal customers like myself.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a prompt and satisfactory resolution.",2023-12-30 12:00:00-05:00,Getting a credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,21228,,True,8082733,Yes,Consent provided,Closed with explanation,Web,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,2023-12-30 12:00:00-05:00,MD,N/A,,Delay in processing application,"Reference # [R] Dear Chase Card Services, I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep frustration and dissatisfaction with the challenges I have encountered while attempting to open business credit cards with Chase. As a longstanding customer, I have recently experienced a series of perplexing and time-consuming issues that have significantly impacted my confidence in the application process. 

In early [R], I applied for the Chase Ink Business card, and to my relief, the "
Credit card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I completed a balance transfer from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to my Chase World of Hyatt Visa card in the amount of {$7700.00}. The offer for the balance transfer was for 0 % interest if paid by XX/XX/XXXX. There was a 5 % fee for the balance transfer, totaling {$380.00}. Upon reviewing my statement dated XX/XX/XXXX, it appeared that the payments I had made in the statement period had been applied incorrectly. 

According to the statement, I had an existing balance of {$10000.00} prior to the beginning of the statement period. During the month, I completed the {$7700.00} balance transfer, {$1400.00} in purchases, and made {$4500.00} in payments, leaving me with a total balance of {$15000.00}. The statement shows a {$9800.00} balance subject to a 28.24 % APR and {$6400.00} subject to a 0 % APR The minimum payment for the period was {$400.00}. I was charged the {$380.00} balance transfer fee and {$220.00} in interest. 

The statement states, under the section How to Avoid Paying Interest on Balances : "" Because we apply payments in excess of your minimum payment first to higher rate balances, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new purchases if you have another balance at a higher rate unless you pay your balance ( or Interest Saving Balance ) in full each month. '' Likewise, 1026.53, states that except on the two statements immediately preceding the expiration of the promotional rate or at the request of the consumer, "" when a consumer makes a payment in excess of the required minimum periodic payment for a credit card account under an open-end ( not home-secured ) consumer credit plan, the card issuer must allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on the applicable annual percentage rate. '' If Chase had followed both their policy and 1026.53, at most {$400.00} of the payments made should have applied to the promotional. More likely, less than that amount should have applied as part of that minimum would have been for the standard APR balance ; however, Chase does not show on the statement which part of the minimum payment was for which balance, so we will give them the benefit of the doubt and apply th entirety of the {$400.00} to the promotional balance. If they had done that, the promotional balance would have been {$7300.00}, and the standard APR balance would have been {$8900.00} ; the interest charged would have been {$210.00}, {$17.00} less than I was actually charged. If they had applied the minimum payment proportionally, only {$180.00} would have gone to the promotional balance, leading to a promotional balance of {$7500.00}, a standard balance of {$8700.00} and an interest charge of {$200.00}, {$22.00} less than I was charged. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Chase to ask about the issue. I was initially told by the customer service agent that I was correct and that the statement was simply showing the incorrect amount for the promotional balance. When she gave me what she calculated as the purchase balance, however, it was still incorrect, so she transferred me to a supervisor. When I explained the situation to the supervisor, I was told that, in contradiction to the policy listed in the statement and 1026.53, in fact payments were allocated first to purchases made during the statement period, and all payments after that would go toward the promotional balance. When I told her that was incorrect and in violation of 1026.53, she told me she was ending the conversation and hung up. 

Obviously, what she told me is still wrong, as that would have meant the promotional balance would be {$5100.00} as {$1400.00} would have gone toward the purchases, {$400.00} would have been the minimum, and the remaining {$2600.00} would have been applied to the promotional balance. It appears that maybe they applied the rest of the payment proportionally to the two total balances, but that still is in contradiction to both their own stated policy and 1026.53.",2023-12-30 12:00:00-05:00,Problem when making payments,General-purpose credit card or charge card,XXXXX,,True,8082821,Yes,Consent provided,Closed with explanation,Web,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,2023-12-30 12:00:00-05:00,UT,N/A,,Problem during payment process,"On [R], I completed a balance transfer from my [R] to my Chase World of Hyatt Visa card in the amount of {$7700.00}.

Credit card,"I've been having a litany of problems with Chase over the past 2 months and I have reason to believe they have broken a multitude of consumer finance laws regarding both of my credit card accounts. 

At some point in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX, they introduced a new digital services agreement requiring consent to access your online accounts. Upon advice from a lawyer, I did not consent to either of these digital service agreements due to privacy concerns. Therefore, I have been locked out of my online Chase accounts and unable to pay my bills online or access my rewards for both credit card accounts. I did not consent to these agreements because I refuse to allow Chase to sell my private financial data to data brokers. 

I've previously had a XXXX  % on-time payment history in my XXXX  years of credit history, but have been having a number of personal & financial difficulties recently including job loss, illness, and XXXX. So I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX to request a deferment or forbearance on my accounts. I felt this was a reasonable request considering my payment history as well as the hyperinflationary crisis occurring in the macroeconomy. Chase refused to grant me this request and instead advised me to not pay my bills and go into default on my accounts. While speaking to Chase on XX/XX/XXXX, I was informed that there were additional changes to their agreement terms that were separate from the updated digital services agreement which were sent to my online accounts. I was not able to access these new terms because I was previously setup for electronic communications, but was/am locked out of my online Chase accounts so did not receive these important time-sensitive notices affecting my legal rights. I requested they send me these new terms in the mail in a timely manner so I could forward them to a lawyer for review. 

Instead of receiving these updated terms in a timely manner, Chase sent me a printed notice dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they had not sent any changes to my account recently. I will note this is notice is factually incorrect and contrary to what I was told over the phone. 

I again had to call Chase on XX/XX/XXXX after receiving this incorrect notice to request printed agreement terms to forward to a lawyer for review. Instead of receiving these agreement terms, I received a printed notice from Chase dated XX/XX/XXXX incorrectly stating that one of my accounts had been closed at my request. I never requested for that account to be closed and when I called Chase for clarification on XX/XX/XXXX I was told by multiple people that XXXX of my accounts were still open and in good standing. 

My understanding is that this is duplicitous, unethical, and illegal for breaking consumer finance regulations. Chase has repeatedly told me things over the phone that are contrary & contradictory to things that Chase has mailed me in writing. This lead to me forming a support ticket with Chase 's executive office which is still under their internal investigation. I also requested a hardship settlement for my accounts but was denied over the phone, which is contrary to a printed letter they previously sent me in writing. 

Since I had not received the updated terms yet and the issue was time-sensitive, a lawyer was able to track down the revised agreement terms from another Chase Freedom Unlimited customer. The lawyer notified me the new agreement terms contained an arbitration agreement which had to be opted out of in-writing in a timely manner. So I wrote & mailed two letters each dated XX/XX/XXXX notifying Chase that I reject their arbitration agreements. I later received the updated terms for XXXX  accounts which were dated XX/XX/XXXX but I did not receive them until after I mailed my letters of arbitration rejection on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I made the minimum payment due of {$720.00} for XXXX of my accounts in-person Under Duress. The payment was made Under Duress because Chase refused to grant me a deferment, forbearance, or hardship settlement, and I had to borrow the money to make the payment even though I can not afford it. I will note that Chase refused these simple, reasonable requests despite us being in an active dispute requiring them to conduct an internal investigation over the integrity of their systems. I will also note that making payments in-person is extremely inconvenient for me, and that making payments over the phone aren't a secure method to pay due to various technological reasons. 

I called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX to check if my letters had been received but was initially told they had not been received. After informing Chase that I sent the letters with XXXX tracking numbers and could prove they received the letters on XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX respectively, they admitted they received the letters. This resulted in me having an additional support ticket created by Chase 's escalation department which is separate from the support ticket created by Chase 's XXXX office. I was told over the phone that Chase rejected my rejection of arbitration for XXXX account but not the other. I have yet to receive this letter of notice in the mail. 

My understanding is Chase has broken XXXX consumer finance laws through my correspondence with them over the past couple of months. I also have reason to believe their systems have been hacked or compromised since they have sent me multiple factually incorrect letters in error. My understanding is that this is a violation of Chase 's fiduciary responsibility to safeguard & protect my private financial data, and that they are liable for damages if I choose to sue them in a court of law.",2024-01-01 12:00:00-05:00,"Other features, terms, or problems",General-purpose credit card or charge card,97223,,True,8085570,Yes,Consent provided,Closed with explanation,Web,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,2023-12-31 12:00:00-05:00,OR,N/A,,Other problem,"I've been having a litany of problems with Chase over the past 2 months and I have reason to believe they have broken a multitude of consumer finance laws regarding both of my credit card accounts.

Credit card,"Hi, This is XXXX XXXX card act # - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and have stellar credit, scoring in the XXXX range ( with the XXXX major bureaus ) This XXXX I applied for two chase cards and got instantly approved. I used the cards throughout the XXXX paid my bills on time, and early.However I was shocked when approximately 4 months after opening my account Chase bank notified me that my accounts were being closed, the reason they provided was "" due to previous accounts with chase ''. 

About 8 years ago I had XXXX credit cards from chase which were all one day terminated due to "" system generated closure '' at the time I attempted to get any more information I can from chase but no matter who I spoke to and sent letters to, no information was made available to me, other than "" the account were closed due to a system generated closure '' I was very upset, as I had relationships with other banks, and hadn't had any issues with any other banks, and here I was not being given any tangible info, or any recourse to have it reviewed. 

So now when I got closed from chase a second time, for the same reason as the first I was really preturbed, as I have around XXXX credit card accounts with a few different banks, none of my accounts were ever paid late in my lifetime, I have a stellar record and rating, and I'm just being stonewalled by everyone at Chase Bank. I even went for review at chase 's executive branch and they claimed as well, that they have no information other than I was closed due to pervious account closure, and when they attempt to find the reason for the previous account 's closure they come up empty. 
I'm being persecuted and taken advantage of here, this is aggravating, and humiliating, and I demand to be reinstated and have my accounts be returned to their good standing, unless there's a valid reason for me not being able to have a credit account with Chase bank, of which I deserve to know, as I believe I'm being racially targeted here. I only wish a good resolution, I trust you will help me achieve one.
