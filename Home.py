The user will present a table of customer complaints. Your task is to use it to:
1. Look for commonalities in the complaints. Are there specific products or services that are generating more complaints? Are complaints more frequent during certain times?
2. Delve into the details of a few individual complaints that stand out to understand the specifics of customer grievances and their expectations.
Note that some of the contents may be redacted for privacy reasons with [R] in the text."""

DEFAULT_SUMMARY ="""\
### Common Complaint Themes

1. **Product Issues**: The majority of complaints revolve around checking or savings accounts, followed by credit card services. There are also mentions of credit reporting or other personal consumer reports, and money transfer, virtual currency, or money service. This indicates that the primary areas of customer dissatisfaction are related to banking accounts and credit services.

2. **Recurring Issues**:
   - **Overdraft Fees**: Several complaints about checking or savings accounts mention high overdraft fees, such as being charged $34.00 for an overdraft of $7.00. This suggests a systemic issue with how overdrafts are handled and communicated to customers.
   - **Account Access and Transaction Issues**: Customers have encountered problems accessing their funds, closing their accounts, and issues with transactions getting stuck due to system glitches or account holds.
   - **Disputes with Credit Card Transactions**: Complaints about credit cards often mention disputes over fraudulent charges and issues with the bankâ€™s dispute resolution process.

3. **Timing**: A significant number of complaints are concentrated around the end of January 2024, with a particular emphasis on the last day of the month. This may indicate systemic issues or process breakdowns during this time frame, possibly related to end-of-month financial activities.

### Detailed Examination of Individual Complaints

1. **Overdraft Fees Complained by Customer ID 8256566**:
   - **Issue**: The customer is upset about multiple high overdraft fees for relatively small amounts.
   - **Expectation**: It appears the customer expects lower or waived overdraft fees, especially since they mention having pending credits to their account that would cover the overdrafts.

2. **Account Closure Issue Complained by Customer ID 8261625**:
   - **Issue**: The customer mentions an inability to close their savings account due to a system issue, followed by a claim of a wrongful balance shown upon account closure.
   - **Expectation**: There's an evident expectation for a smoother account closure process and accurate final account balance communication.

3. **Credit Card Fraud Issue Complained by Customer ID 8258217**:
   - **Issue**: The customer faced fraudulent charges on their account and struggled with the bankâ€™s process to remove those charges.
   - **Expectation**: The customer likely expected a more straightforward process for resolving fraud charges, including clarity on account closure and reconciliation.

4. **Money Transfer Complaint ID 8258585**:
   - **Issue**: A customer sends a large sum to a fraudulent account due to intercepted wire instructions and struggles with getting assistance from the bank.
   - **Expectation**: The customer seeks effective communication regarding the status of their funds and expects the bank to assist in recovering the lost money.

### Conclusion
The complaints suggest that JPMORGAN CHASE & CO. could improve in areas related to handling overdraft fees, system glitches affecting account transactions and closures, clarity and efficiency in dispute resolutions, and support for fraud and scam victims. Addressing these issues could potentially reduce the volume of similar complaints and improve overall customer satisfaction."""

st.title("Gen AI for Handling Customer Complaints")
st.write("""\
This demo showcases the application of Generative AI (Gen AI) in managing customer complaints,
- The example complaint data is live from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
- With the example data, Gen AI can then be used to summarize the complaints and provide specific insights into the data. (In its
    current state, the demo only supports OpenAI API, but it is fairly easy to extend it to other APIs.)

To reduce cost, the data is preprocessed to minimize the amount of tokens sent to the model. The more results you fetch, the more
cost you will incur. So be mindful when choosing the number of results. We also recommend using monitoring tools to keep track of
token usage and leverage optimizations techniques like caching.

While not shown in this demo, we have also experimented with using Gen AI for other tasks like:
1. Simplifying feedback collection and self-triage for customer support
2. Generating starter responses to customer complaints which unlocks efficiency gain
3. Automatic visualization of data using natural language which democratizes data analysis for non-technical users and stakeholders

While some of these applications might not be relevant using the data shown here, the similar techniques can be applied to other 
unstructured or private data, to modernize data collection and streamline customer support and data analysis workflows.  We hope
you find this demo helpful and inspiring for your own projects.\
